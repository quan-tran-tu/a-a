- Each actions in the same serie can have its own goroutine: eg. crawl for html content of different web pages
- Each series of actions can have its own goroutine: eg. no serie bottleneck

- More complicated series of actions: eg. create new github repo: first go to github.com, get steps to create new repo, at each step parse the html source to act accordingly
